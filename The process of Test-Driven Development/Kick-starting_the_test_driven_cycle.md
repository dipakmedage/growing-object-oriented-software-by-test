* We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing.Action always generaes inspiration.Inspiration seldom generates action
* First Test  walking skeleton
* The problem in writting and passing first acceptance test is that its hard to build both the tooling and the feature its testing at the same time .changes in one thinf will disrupt in other thing and tracking down failures is tricky when the architecture,the test and production code are all moving.
* We can cut this problem into 2 smaller problems 
    * First work out how to build,deploy and test walking skeleton 
    * Use that infrastructure to write acceptance test for the first meaningful feature.
* One thing we learn that nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate it .
